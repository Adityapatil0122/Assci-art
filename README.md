# 🎨 ASCII Art Collection

Welcome to my **Crazy ASCII Art Repository**!  
This repo contains creative text-based artworks made using symbols and characters — pure coding fun and imagination.  

## 🧠 About
ASCII Art is the practice of creating visual designs using standard text characters.  
Here, I’ve added a collection of my own experiments and cool patterns — all made for fun and learning!

## 📁 Contents
- Pattern designs  
- Text-based shapes  
- Artistic experiments  
- Random creative scripts  

## 💡 Why I Made This
I’m exploring creative sides of programming — not just logic and syntax, but *art through code*.  
Perfect for practice, curiosity, or just something different to share on GitHub!

## ⚙️ How to Use
Clone the repo and run any file in your terminal or IDE to see the artwork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
python art.py
